# Notelang: A Domain-Specific Language for Musical Notation ðŸŽ¼

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
**Notelang** is a theoretical **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** designed as part of the **COMPILERS course project**. The primary objective is to explore key concepts in **compiler construction**, including **lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic processing, and code generation**. This project serves as an academic exercise in understanding **language design and DSL implementation**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- **Study compiler design** by implementing a structured DSL.
- **Define a formal syntax** for musical notation elements like notes, tempo, and dynamics.
- **Explore parsing techniques** for language interpretation and execution.
- **Investigate potential export capabilities** (e.g., MIDI, JSON, PDF) in future iterations.

## ðŸ›  Development Scope
Notelang is currently in the **design and specification phase**, focusing on:
- Defining the **grammar and syntax** of the language.
- Establishing **semantic rules** for musical notation.
- Implementing the language structure using **ANSI C**.

## ðŸ“– Future Considerations
Once the theoretical aspects are refined, Notelang may evolve into an **interpreted or compiled language** capable of translating structured notation into a machine-readable format, bridging the gap between **compiler theory and practical applications in music technology**.
